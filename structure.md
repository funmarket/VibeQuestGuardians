# VibeQuestGuardians — Structure.md

**Document ID:** VQ-STRUC-001  
**Status:** Revised architecture proposal for Product Owner review; not published or authorized for implementation  
**Date:** 2026-10-30  
**Destination:** `funmarket/VibeQuestGuardians` / `vibefoundation`  
**Companion:** `Requirements.md` (product contract); domain ownership register `docs/product-design/02_DOMAIN_OWNERSHIP_FINAL_LEAN.md` (canonical 28-row domain identities, pending its formal approval).

## 1. Purpose, scope and architectural decision hierarchy

This document defines **how to organize the new application**, not what the product experience should be or the SQL schema. `Requirements.md` specifies the intended UI/UX and behavior recovered from `vibequest-fixed-v2 (2).zip`, the attached source-behavior narratives, and Product Owner decisions. The ZIP is **behavior and visual reference, not reusable engineering authority**. Historical Gemini's suggested structure/schema are **ideas**, not accepted configuration, schema or deployment evidence.

**Engineering objective:** preserve Home / Explore / Share / Vibe / Purse, their distinct sections and modal journeys, and the original aesthetic while rebuilding with genuine authenticated records, server-owned invariants, real media, notifications, geolocation and transactions. Avoid silent feature removal because a legacy function was fake. No fake users, seeded production interactions, mock payments, success-on-failure fallbacks or localStorage pretending to be business authority.

**Decision precedence:** newest Product Owner direction → accepted requirements → authoritative 28-domain ownership → historical observable UX → proposed implementation. Where no implementation choice is approved, this document specifies a testable architecture option rather than pretending a provider or technology is locked. **All 28 logical domains are in the target initial application; logical domains are not 28 databases, deployables, teams or migrations.**

## 2. Architectural approach and deployment topology

**Recommended architecture: modular monolith with explicit domain boundaries**, plus separately runnable asynchronous worker(s) and a single shared Web/Telegram client. This is a recommendation to approve at Structure review, not a statement that the current repository already implements it. It minimizes premature distributed-systems complexity while retaining extraction seams for scaling. Each module controls business mutations and exports intentional application interfaces; cross-domain reads can use authorized query projections.

  Outbox --> Worker[Background jobs / notification / projection workers]
  Worker --> DB
  Worker --> Notify[Push / realtime adapters]
  Modules --> Media[Global media domain / object store adapter]
  Modules --> Realtime[Realtime transport]
```

- One canonical backend for browser and Telegram; Telegram identity must be validated server-side, and a host adapter provides theme, back-button, viewport and haptics. Telegram cannot own a second ledger or user directory.
- API serves authenticated commands and permission-aware reads; reads do not bypass business invariants or reveal private data. No direct client SQL/DB credentials.
- Start with one transactional database where appropriate. A separate event broker, external cache or multiple services should be adopted only on measured need; events alone do not replace durable transactional correctness.
- Workers handle deadlines, deduped event delivery, geofence processing, media retention, notification retries and reporting; server timestamps and persistence determine truth, not client timers.
- Admin is a **privileged application interface** to domain commands and audit logs, not a 29th business writer.

## 3. Proposed repository organization

The following is a **target logical layout**, not a claim these paths exist or a command to regenerate the repository. Retain/refactor current authorized files rather than deleting established work. Names are illustrative; approved coding conventions can tune path labels without changing boundaries.

```

**Binding feature-boundary rule:** Every independent user-facing experience has an explicit feature owner and cohesive state/interaction boundary; a page composes features and must not recreate legacy 700–1,100-line orchestration components. Feature folders above are a readable proposed mapping, not a fixed number of files or separate backend domains. Shared components remain reusable without merging feature responsibilities; a component's scope is evaluated by cohesion and dependencies, not arbitrary line limits. Each feature defines its public entry point, internal presentation/state/capability adapters, required domain commands/queries, loading/denied/failure states and permitted cross-feature navigation. No feature imports another feature's private state or persistence implementation. Domain commands always go through authorized typed contracts.

**Legacy code adaptation contract:** Inspect the exact original control and dependency chain; recover the user-visible purpose; distinguish usable bounded algorithms/presentation techniques from simulation and backend coupling; adapt only verified useful logic into the new owner's interface and test it in isolation. Never copy old screens/services wholesale or port their localStorage, Firebase/Firestore, fallback accounts, mock coordinates, fake media, simulated messaging, auto-accepted reservations or pretend credits. A broken backend is a reason to implement the behavior properly, never to omit the user-facing feature.

## 4. Canonical 28 business modules and single writers

The names/ownership below mirror the **current new-repository domain register**; the domain **identity and responsibility** outrank Gemini's suggested folder labels. Proposed directory keys do not grant new domain ownership.

| ID | Proposed module key | Sole domain-owned business state |
|---|---|---|
| D01 | `identity` | Accounts, sessions, credential/Telegram links, recovery |
| D02 | `profiles` | Public presentation, preferences, localization/accessibility settings |
| D03 | `social-graph` | Follow/block relationship records |
| D04 | `geo-presence` | Consented location evidence, freshness, geofences and proximity assertions |
| D05 | `places` | Places, check-ins, contributions, validation observations |
| D06 | `trails` | Trail itinerary, stops/order, lineage, edits and public versions |
| D07 | `guardians` | Local Legend/Pro eligibility, live selfie freshness, qualifications, offers |
| D08 | `tours-reservations` | Guided Tour offer/bookability, slots, requests, acceptance/decline/cancel |
| D09 | `businesses-organizations` | Verified organizational identities and operator permissions |
| D10 | `activities` | Community activities, schedules, participation, resonance eligibility |
| D11 | `events` | Organizer Events and RSVP, independent of tickets |
| D12 | `social-content` | Posts, ephemeral Vibes, Gossip, reactions/comments, visibility |
| D13 | `global-media` | Asset uploads, verification metadata, variants, visibility and lifecycle |
| D14 | `messaging` | Direct and contextual conversations, messages, receipts |
| D15 | `live-rooms` | Live room sessions, participant/speaker state |
| D16 | `communities` | Vibe Circles, membership, invitation and community permissions |
| D17 | `matching` | Drift, Pulls, bilateral confirmation, specialized match proposals |
| D18 | `challenges` | VibeCheck/VibeFlash initiation, deadlines, responses, Mosaic entitlement |
| D19 | `recognition` | Badges, Passport recognition, reputation, review eligibility signals |
| D20 | `vq-ledger` | Reward rules, awards, transfers if approved, reconciled balances, admin grants |
| D21 | `moderation` | Reports, restrictions, enforcement and appeal |
| D22 | `handshakes` | Idempotent qualifying agreement/Handshake records and review access proof |
| D23 | `notifications` | Notification inbox, unread state, preferences, delivery attempts |
| D24 | `advertising` | Sponsorship/campaigns/placements and impression accounting |
| D25 | `subscriptions` | Plan lifecycles, subscription and access entitlements |
| D26 | `marketplace` | Peer listings, buyer/seller offers, negotiation and deal status |
| D27 | `payments-billing` | Real-money payment records, reconciliation, refunds, billing |
| D28 | `ticketing` | Independent ticket inventory, issuance, validation/admission |

**Cross-domain coordinator:** one explicitly named application-level use-case orchestrator coordinates multi-owner commands, without becoming a second authoritative writer; transaction/outbox boundaries and idempotency remain domain-owned. **Domain internal pattern (when complexity warrants):** `domain/` for invariants/entities, `application/` for commands and read interfaces, `infrastructure/` for persistence/transport adapters, `interfaces/` for API/message handlers. Do not force empty four-layer boilerplate into simple modules. Each authoritative business entity has one mutation entry point. Modules reference canonical IDs through explicit contracts; cross-domain operations coordinate via a use case with an owned transaction or outbox, not direct table writes from unrelated modules.

## 5. UI composition and original product parity

Treat the ZIP as source of **visible capabilities, choreography, labels and design character**. Specifically retain interactive, contextual flows rather than copying former component nesting:

| Destination | Composed capabilities / cross-page relations | Primary domains consumed |
|---|---|---|
| **Home** | City calibration/search; check-in carousel; live Secrets banner; My Network/Local Vibes/For You; activities/events; streak; Heritage coordinates; Local Gems; VIBE Guide; live feed; Find Hub contact/geofence/history | D02–D05, D10–D12, D16, D19–D20, D23 |
| **Explore** | Search/map/category radar; Places and Waze-style Yes/No/Not Here Validate; Secrets; Trail creation/remix/route/offline; paid Tour cards; Pro/Legend Guardian directory, hiring from Trail and consultations | D04–D09, D11, D13–D14, D20, D22–D23 |
| **Share** | Emotional pillars; live/dual camera, photo/video, moods; 24h Stream, Join Vibe, Echoes; VibeCheck180s, VibeFlash33s/Mosaic; Circles and gratitude | D04, D12–D13, D15–D16, D18, D20, D23, D27 |
| **Vibe** | Gossip and inline post/engagement, Drift 12 wavelengths, Pull invitations, Vibes accepted matches, Orbit/Echo follow state, Polar/Social match modes and messaging | D02–D03, D12–D14, D17, D23 |
| **Purse** | VQ balance/rules/ledger; send/receive only as approved; genuine scannable Traveler Code concept; marketplace browse/list/negotiate/mark completed with genuine deal state | D01–D02, D14, D20, D22–D23, D26–D27 |

Preserve equal tab sizing, mobile-first Midnight Obsidian/neon styling, visible state transitions, navigation, gestures, modal workflows, deep links, error/retry, empty states, Telegram adaptation and EN/FR/AR with RTL. Share heart is **not** a floating/oversized separate action under current requirements. A feature's entry point may appear in several screens, but all points reference the same authoritative business object. Former ZIP paths (`src/screens/ExploreScreen.tsx`, `src/features/explore/components/CreateTrailModal.tsx`, `TrailDetailModal.tsx`, `VibeGuardians/*`, `src/features/home/components/FindHubModal.tsx`, `src/components/chat/VibeCenterView.tsx`, `src/features/crypto/components/CryptoDashboard.tsx`, etc.) are **mapping references**, not paths to transplant.

## 6. Interfaces, transactional truth and cross-domain flows

- **Commands** express intent (`SubmitPlaceValidation`, `PublishTrail`, `AcceptGuardianRequest`, `PostVqAward`, `SendMessage`, `ConfirmMarketplaceDeal`, `RedeemTicket`). Each validates identity/permissions, updates its canonical domain, and returns authoritative status/errors.
- **Queries** compose permitted projections for Home, Explore, Vibe, profiles and admin. Projection lag must be transparent where users need confirmation of a consequential change.
- **Events** represent committed facts, not instructions to mint credits. Event envelopes include stable IDs, source domain, schema version, actor/subject, occurrence time and causal correlation. Producers persist domain changes and outbox atomically where necessary; consumers idempotently process and can replay safely.
- **Cross-domain orchestration:** a place validation is owned by D05 using D04 evidence; D20 independently evaluates configured award eligibility. D08 accepts a Hire request, then D22 issues exactly one Handshake for the qualifying accepted agreement; not a physical GPS/QR encounter. D23 routes notifications without creating the booking. D27 reconciles actual payment before D08/D28 final paid entitlement. Ticketing D28 may operate without D11 Event linkage.
- **Failure semantics:** no happy-success UI after failed authoritative writes; preserve pending/failed/retry states, prevent duplicate submissions, handle timeout and late update, and reconcile eventual delivery separately from the committed business transaction.
- **Admin:** auditable rule edits and grants call D20 commands; staff roles cannot edit the ledger through direct SQL shortcuts. Similar principle for moderation, guardians and subscriptions.

## 6A. Reusable device permissions and consent boundary (mandatory)

**Binding rule:** geographic location, camera and microphone are three independently requestable permissions. A feature may explain why access is requested; only the relevant browser/operating-system/Telegram host can grant its hardware capability. An in-app Apply toggle never substitutes for an actual device grant. Permission status is assessed on use and after host foreground/resume where supported, not permanently assumed from a saved preference. 

| Capability | Consuming frontend features | Shared infrastructure vs business authority |
|---|---|---|
| Location | Home city, Explore map/radar/Place validation, Find Hub mutual presence/geofences, Share opted-in geotag, nearby discovery | Client adapter obtains device coordinates with accuracy/freshness or truthful denial; D04 authorizes consent, evidence and proximity. D03 follow/block and specific feature privacy settings constrain sharing. |
| Camera | Share live shot and dual sequential capture, Guardian recurring in-app selfie, VibeCheck/VibeFlash capture, eligible Join Vibe | Device adapter opens/stops tracks and reports actual availability; D13 manages validated media; D07/D18 govern selfie/challenge eligibility. Never synthesize a proof photo on failure. |
| Microphone | Video-with-sound, voice notes, eligible Share Echo audio, live-room voice | Device adapter requests/cleans up streams; D13 manages uploaded recorded audio; D14 messages and D15 realtime rooms own their respective communication authorization. No recording of live-room audio by default. |

**Required shared states:** not requested, explanation shown, requesting, granted, denied, blocked/unavailable, temporarily interrupted and revoked (host APIs may not expose all states; do not falsely claim detection). Handle browser secure-context constraints and Telegram WebView differences, per-feature retries, user-readable settings guidance, and consistent resource cleanup on exit, cancellation, logout and device change. No one-time global permission grant is a substitute for feature-specific consent. Declining microphone must not prevent independent location-only browsing; declining location must not invent GPS or silently share exact coordinates. Background location tracking is not implied by normal geolocation permission.

**Permission + privacy flow:** user intention → feature rationale → host permission request → actual hardware availability → feature-specific user opt-in → server-side authorization/evidence where relevant → canonical business effect. Disabling Find Hub sharing, revoking access or blocking a contact must stop further disclosure independently of operating-system GPS permission. Location, camera and microphone APIs are testable via adapters with explicit *test-only* fake capabilities that never enter production.

## 6B. Trail authoring, adoption, remix and Tour composition

- D06 owns free Trails from any eligible authenticated member, ordered stops, publication/versioning, adoption/remix, immutable original attribution and lineage. `trail-adoption-remix` creates a separate derivative; no overwrite of the original author record. Multiple screens use the same Trail identity and deep-link contract.
- Eligible Pro Guardians may start a commercial Tour from scratch **or adopt an existing Trail or remixed derivative** into the Tour-authoring experience. The existing Trail remains a free, attributable Trail; D08 owns commercial Tour offer details, bookability, rates, dates and reservations, with D07 and D25 determining Pro entitlement/eligibility.
- `Label this as a Tour` is an eligible authoring interaction, not a conversion that deletes or appropriates the source Trail. Tour itinerary can reference the appropriate Trail version or maintain an explicitly attributable itinerary derivative under D06 contracts; the exact persisted representation belongs to Database.md, not an agent-invented new product policy.
- A Pro Guardian can be hired to guide an **existing free Trail** without first forcing it into a published commercial Tour. Context and Trail identity travel through D08's accepted-request flow; D22 records one eligible Handshake on actual acceptance, not on opening the Hire UI.

## 7. Data and database boundary — schema intentionally deferred

Structure chooses a **relational transactional persistence boundary** with spatial query capability as a strong candidate; exact tables, constraints, SQL migrations, indexes and versions belong in later **Database.md**. The database model follows domain ownership, real data sensitivity and transaction requirements; it is **not derived from Gemini's printed ERD**.

Proposed persistence partitions: private identity; public profile; consented ephemeral precise location with short retention and separate geofence rules; Places/check-ins; Trails/stop versions/remix links; Guardians/entitlements and Tour availability; social posts/media/reactions; conversations/rooms; challenge state; recognition; VQ ledger and rules; notifications; Marketplace; payments; independent tickets. Avoid shared write tables and invented cross-domain FKs that create circular service authority. A shared DB may enforce legitimate relational constraints while modules retain code-level write boundaries.

**Location proof is not inherently trustworthy GPS**: device latitude/longitude, EXIF and capture timestamps are untrusted inputs; use consent, accuracy, freshness, replay resistance, anomaly handling and explicit evidence confidence. No claim of hardware watermark guarantee. PostGIS can accelerate proximity calculations but cannot by itself establish user presence. Respect approved Find Hub temporary-ping retention, not permanent surveillance.

**VQ is internal reward accounting, not SOL crypto.** D20 must support auditable append-only posting, versioned Admin reward policies, uniqueness/idempotency, reversal entries and integrity checks. Whether double-entry is appropriate requires a concrete accounts/invariants design. Marketplace does **not** create an escrow module or commission path; a deal's physical handover is not silently proved by one click. No automatic P2P fiat/crypto exchange service is introduced by historical examples.

## 8. Media, camera, files and offline

D13 owns a media-asset lifecycle with signed/direct upload **as an option**, metadata/status, anti-malware/type validation, size limits, ownership, secure delivery, retention and deletion; choose S3-compatible provider only during infrastructure approval. Camera/device adapter owns permission lifecycle, live front/back sequential capture, optional video duration, PIP reposition and mood filtering; approved Guardian selfie/camera challenges must not silently accept gallery/stock substitutes. Never assert a synthetic fallback is a genuine live capture. Actual proof eligibility is independently controlled by D07/D18 and evidence policy; image metadata alone cannot verify liveness.

Trail save and offline access use **bounded local caching of authorized public content and maps if permitted**, with expiry, provenance and clear offline limitations. No offline check-in, payment, Handshake or VQ award is finalized locally. Cache invalidation and access revocation protect private media/contacts.

## 9. Realtime, scheduling, geo events, notifications and search

- Short-lived VibeCheck (180 seconds) and VibeFlash (33 seconds) use server-created deadlines; client countdown is presentation. Multi-hour Secrets/Flash Events have their own lifecycle. Mosaic is accessible only to eligible responders per approved rule.
- A durable worker handles expired jobs, Guardian 7-day public-selfie eligibility, notification retries, short-lived media cleanup, reservation hold expiry, outbox deliveries and Find Hub geofence transitions. Jobs are idempotent and observable; no fixed cron frequency is silently locked.
- Realtime channels require authenticated membership and privacy checks. D14 private/Guardian/deal conversations are separate UI contexts using authorized records; D15 owns live room sessions. Do not infer a shared soundboard effect is broadcast unless room semantics and transport are explicitly specified.
- Search/discovery indexes are replaceable projections of Places, Trails, Guardians, Events and permitted content. Radar and Home For You cannot invent popularity/ratings. Sponsored content is sourced and labeled through D24.
- D23 owns in-app bell, unread, deep links and delivery attempts. Delivery systems must respect privacy, mute/block rules, quiet hours if adopted, and real push capability; no fake populated notification feed.

## 10. Identity, authorization, privacy and trust boundaries

Single canonical account for browser/Telegram. Browser OAuth/credential auth and Telegram `initData` verification are implementation choices within D01, not separate profile universes. Keep passwords/session secrets inaccessible to public profile queries. Account claims and business/Guardian qualification are distinct. Restrict private location sharing, precise check-in evidence, media capture, DMs, profiles, bookings and payment details to actors with current permissions. Enforce permissions server-side, including admin operations, and use auditable rate limiting for sensitive writes. No user-controlled roles, mock current-user identity, client-only permission switches or auto-accepted reservations.

D22's current Handshake **qualifies on an accepted Hire request** and is **not proof of co-location, physical meeting or payment settlement**. One accepted request cannot mint more than one Handshake, even after retries; review gating follows its approved eligibility rule. A social Pull acceptance is a D17 match, **not** D22 proof. Preserve the Guardian 111-character review and exactly one Good/Chill/Cool badge. Confirm Local Legend analogous workflow only according to documented owner decisions, not Gemini's contradictory narration.

Moderation D21 can restrict harmful accounts/content; D02 manages settings; D19 recognition never converts balance into trust/authority; subscriptions D25 can gate paid Pro visibility but cannot validate identity by payment alone.

## 10A. Mandatory document architecture-conformance gate

Before calling this Structure proposal ready for Product Owner approval, verify independently against Requirements.md and the established 15-rule VibeBehaviorGate: (1) no mega-feature implementation, (2) distinct UI feature homes, (3) single writers for all 28 logical domains, (4) defined coordination interfaces, (5) legacy UX and deep-link preservation, (6) Trail adoption/remix and Pro Tour reuse, (7) location/camera/mic permission lifecycles, (8) Web/Telegram shared product and verified identity, (9) independent media/DM/rooms/notification owners, (10) no fake authoritative outcomes, (11) all five equal tabs and accessible responsive design, (12) no reopened settled policy. Resolve source-verifiable contradictions in the current draft, never present an old rule as a new suggestion. Do not claim a runtime test or complete button inventory merely because architecture checks pass.

## 11. Operations, quality gates and release sequence

**CI:** formatting, types, lint, dependency/security checks, schema/contract compatibility, unit tests of invariants, module boundary import rules, migration checks and representative client component tests. **Integration:** independent test users, Web and Telegram account linking, real read/write authorizations, live place proximity evidence, Trail remix attribution, Guardian acceptance and exactly-one Handshake, VQ idempotency, Find Hub consent revocation, challenge expiry, messages delivery/failure, Marketplace deal state, media deletion and independent Ticketing redemption. Use clearly marked synthetic fixtures **only** in isolated tests/staging; never seed fabricated user activity as production reality.

**Observability:** structured logs with correlation/causation IDs, outcome metrics, privacy-safe tracing and immutable privileged audit records. **Readiness:** distinguish API liveness from database/migration/media/worker dependency compatibility; avoid declaring a deploy healthy because the process runs. **Release:** migration compatibility, versioned contracts, explicit rollout/rollback, verified worker and client backend compatibility. Do not encode automatic deployment or GitHub publishing without permission. No source/requirements document is proof of deployed functionality.

**Acceptance of architecture (not app build):** prove that the proposed module map accounts for all 28 canonical domains; each cross-domain example has one writer; all five original navigation destinations and high-value interactions have client composition locations; Web/Telegram share one authority; design separates privacy, billing, VQ and reputation; backend mechanics not prematurely fixed; open provider decisions are recorded without being invented. Future implementation tests then prove runtime behavior.

## 12. Gemini proposal: reuse decisions and explicit rejections

| Suggested concept | Architecture disposition |
|---|---|
| Domain-oriented server modules, layered business logic | **Adapt** as bounded modules, avoid boilerplate/28 deployables |
| React responsive client and Telegram SDK adapter | **Candidate**, confirm existing repository and target stack before hard lock |
| PostgreSQL + PostGIS | **Strong candidate**, verify provider/version/extension and operational needs |
| Transactional outbox, workers, storage adapter | **Retain principles**, choose mechanisms during detailed design |
| 28 migration files and mandatory four layers for every domain | **Reject as arbitrary file counts**, derive migrations and layers from functionality |
| Fixed 412-px app shell and mandatory view <250 lines | **Reject as universal constraints**, require responsive UX and maintainability instead |
| 10-m GPS + QR physical Handshake | **Reject**: accepted in-app Hire agreement defines current Handshake |
| Marketplace VQ escrow, release on QR and fee | **Reject**: direct seller, no escrow, no commission |
| GPS metadata/hardware watermark guarantees live authenticity | **Reject guarantee**: device data untrusted, risk-controlled evidence required |
| Account role solely from `role` column | **Revise**: separate identity, Guardian qualification, subscriptions, organization authority and admin permissions |
| Single container guaranteed Railway readiness | **Reject guarantee**: deployment topology and readiness require actual environmental proof |
| Historical SOL/Devnet crypto UI | **Exclude** from approved economy; preserve Purse intent using real VQ |

## 13. Design decisions to settle in Structure/Database phase (without reopening Requirements)

1. Target toolchain/repo workspaces and runtime versions, based on current branch and explicit owner choice; do not adopt Gemini's Node/Vite/Fastify by default.
2. API protocol, typed schema, realtime transport and service-to-client authentication; preserve Web/Telegram single authority.
3. PostgreSQL/PostGIS hosting, migration and spatial evidence policy; actual table/index/transaction design deferred to Database.md.
4. Durable outbox/worker implementation and exactly-once *effects* through idempotency (not a false exactly-once transport claim).
5. Media object store and privacy/retention; live-capture threat model and approved proofs.
6. Billing/entitlement providers, Ticketing and Marketplace safety boundaries consistent with accepted scope.
7. Operational configuration, privacy compliance and staging/release security controls.

These are **engineering selection tasks**, not missing product features. Product Owner approvals are requested for material vendor, budget, privacy and commercial decisions; ordinary bounded implementation detail remains the engineering team's responsibility after authorization.

## 14. Sources and verification notes

- **Authoritative for new product:** local `/mnt/data/Requirements.md` (current approved requirements baseline); new repository branch `vibefoundation` `AGENTS.md`, `docs/product-design/00_SOURCE_BASELINE.md`, `01_PRODUCT_DECISIONS_AND_IDEAS.md`, `02_DOMAIN_OWNERSHIP_FINAL_LEAN.md` read at branch commit `8d266d7a221f73520f54a8d304f71be37ce0e6a4` (2026-10-30 inspection). These repository documents retain their own approval-status caveats.
- **Historical reference:** `/mnt/data/vibequest-fixed-v2 (2).zip`, 212 application TS/TSX files with real feature/interaction entry points, including `src/screens/*`, `src/features/home/components/FindHubModal.tsx`, `src/features/explore/components/CreateTrailModal.tsx`, `TrailDetailModal.tsx`, `TrailRemixTree.tsx`, `VibeGuardians/*`, `src/components/chat/VibeCenterView.tsx`, `src/features/share-good-vibes/components/*`, `src/features/crypto/components/CryptoDashboard.tsx`, and `src/features/admin/components/AdminConsole.tsx`.
- **Historical behavior and risks:** `/mnt/data/VIBEQUEST_LEGACY_SAFE_BEHAVIOR_EXTRACTION_EXPLORE_SHARE_HOME_GENERAL_PURSE_2026-10-30.md`, `/mnt/data/vq_audit/AUDIT_FINDINGS.md` and control inventory. Mock mechanisms are evidence of desired UX, never of trustworthy current infrastructure.
- **Non-authoritative proposal:** `/mnt/data/Pasted text.txt` and `/mnt/data/Gemini_Structure_Database_Proposal_Review_2026-10-30.md`. Their claims that files had already been created in GitHub or a specific Railway schema existed have **not** been adopted as proof.

**Document completion statement:** This is a revised **Structure.md review proposal**, not an approved implementation design, actual migration plan or runtime verification. No GitHub, database or deployment mutation was performed to create it. Product Owner may approve this architecture or direct targeted revisions before publishing.
